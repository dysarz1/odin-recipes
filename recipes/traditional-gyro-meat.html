        <h1>Traditional Gyro Meat</h1>
        <img src="../img/gyro_meat.webp" id="gyro" alt="Gyro meat in pita bread">
        <h3>Ingredents</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ onion, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pulse onion in a food processor until finely chopped.
                 Scoop onions onto the center of a towel, gather up the towel ends,
                 and squeeze to remove liquid.</li>
            <li>Combine onions, lamb, beef, garlic, oregano, cumin, marjoram,
                 rosemary, thyme, pepper, and salt in a large bowl.
                 Mix with your hands until well combined. Cover and refrigerate 1
                 to 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place the meat mixture into a food processor and pulse until finely
                 chopped and the texture feels tacky, about 1 minute. Transfer to a 7x4-inch loaf pan, and pack down to make sure there are no air pockets.</li>
            <li>Line a large roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel. Place the loaf
                 pan in the center of the towel-lined roasting pan, and transfer it
                  into the preheated oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the
                   roasting pan until it comes halfway up the sides of the loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until gyro meat is no longer pink in the
                 center and the internal temperature registers 165 degrees
                  F (75 degrees C) on a meat thermometer, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Pour off any accumulated fat, and allow to cool slightly before
                 slicing thinly and serving.</li>
        </ol>
